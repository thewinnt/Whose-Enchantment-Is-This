# Whose Enchantment Is This?

Lets you see which mods add different enchantments on your
items. Hold Ctrl while hovering over an item to see the mods
that add its enchantments (if there are any). Hold Alt to see
the ID of the enchantment instead of its name.

## Dependencies
None. Not even Fabric API.

## Known incompatibilities:
- [Enchancement](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchancement) by MoriyaShiine
- [Enchantips](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchantips) by fedpol1

## Support
I don't intend on actively supporting this mod for now. If you think
you can make something out of this, go ahead and do whatever you want.
